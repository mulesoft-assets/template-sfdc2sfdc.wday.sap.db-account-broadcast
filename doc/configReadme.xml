As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize accounts from a Salesforce Org to another Salesforce Org, Workday, SAP and Database instances.

This Anypoint Template should serve as a foundation for setting an online sync of accounts from a Salesforce instance to many destination systems, using the Publish-subscribe pattern. Every time there is a new account or a change in an already existing one, the integration will poll for changes in the Salesforce source Org, publish the changes to a topic and each subscriber will be responsible for updating the accounts in the target systems.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as example, but also to establish a starting point to adapt the integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this Anypoint Template leverages the [Batch Module](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Batch+Processing).
The batch job is divided into *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

The integration can be triggered in two different ways: by a scheduler defined in the endpoints file or by an outbound notification generated by Salesforce. Either way, the application queries/receives newest Salesforce updates/creations matching a filter criteria and adds them to a JMS topic.

The application has four different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one for migrating the changes to each target system (the second Salesforce Org, Workday, SAP and the DB). During the *Process* stage, each Salesforce account will be matched with an existing account in the target system by Name.
The last step of the *Process* stage will group the accounts and create/update them in target systems.

Finally during the *On Complete* stage the Anypoint Template will log output statistics data into the console.

<![CDATA[
To make this Anypoint Template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made in order for all to run smoothly. **Failing to do so could lead to unexpected behavior of the template.**

1. The batch will fail, if you do not provide correct value for Workday Customer Category Id. You will need to extend the custom mapping, contained in **Transform Account To SubmitCustomerRequest Type** transformation, if accounts with a different than five mapped Salesforce Industry / Workday Customer Category values are updated.

In this section we detail the way you have to run you Anypoint Temple on you computer.

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. The application will poll Account to know if there are any newly created or updated objects and synchronice them.

<![CDATA[
While [creating your application on CloudHub](http://www.mulesoft.org/documentation/display/current/Hello+World+on+CloudHub) (Or you can do it later as a next step), you need to go to Deployment > Advanced to set all environment variables detailed in **Properties to be configured** as well as the **mule.env**. 

Once your app is all set and started, there is no need to do anything else. Every time an account is created or modified, it will be automatically synchronized to Salesforce Org B, Workday and SAP systems and the Database as long as it matches the filtering criteria.

A Category group defines CUSTOMER_CATEGORY_ID for each category as identified in Workday. The values are used for mapping Salesforce Account Industry field to Workday Customer Category. 
If the category is not found between the specified industries, the **category.default** is used.

		<section id="api_calls">
		<![CDATA[
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The Anypoint Template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

***1 + X + X / ${page.size}***

Being ***X*** the number of Accounts to be synchronized on each run. 

The division by ***${page.size}*** is because, by default, Accounts are gathered in groups of ${page.size} for each Upsert API Call in the commit step. Also consider that these calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from origin instance, then 12 api calls will be made (1 + 10 + 1).

		<section id="default_endpoints_xml">
		<![CDATA[
This is file is conformed by a two Flows.

The first one we'll call it **push** flow. This one contains an HTTP endpoint that will be listening for notifications from Salesforce . Each of them will be processed and thus update/create Accounts, and then executing the batch job process.

The second one we'll call it **poll** flow. This one contains the Poll endpoint that will periodically query Salesforce for updated/created Accounts that meet the defined criteria in the query, and then executing the batch job process.

The property **trigger.policy** is the one in charge of defining from which endpoint the Template will recieve the data. The property can only assume one of two values `push` or `poll` any other value will result in the Template ignoring all messages.
