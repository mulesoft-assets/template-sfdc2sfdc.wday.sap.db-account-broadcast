# Anypoint Template: Salesforce to Salesforce, Workday, SAP and Database Account Broadcast	

<!-- Header (start) -->
Synchronizes accounts between a Salesforce instance and many destination systems using the publish-subscribe pattern. Each time an account creates or changes, the integration polls for changes in the Salesforce source organization, publishes the changes to a topic, and each subscriber is responsible for updating the accounts in the target systems.

The application has four different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one each for broadcasting the changes to the four destination systems (the second Salesforce organization, Workday, SAP, and the database). During the Process stage, each Salesforce account is matched with an existing account in the destination system by Name. The last step of the Process stage groups the accounts and creates or updates them in the destination systems.

Finally during the On Complete stage the template logs output statistics data to the console.

# Use Case
<!-- Use Case (start) -->
As a Salesforce admin I want to synchronize accounts from a Salesforce organization to another Salesforce organization, Workday, SAP, and Database instances.

This template serves as a foundation for setting an online sync of accounts from a Salesforce instance to many destination systems, using the Publish-subscribe pattern. Every time there is a new account or a change in an existing one, the integration polls for changes in the Salesforce source organization, publishes the changes to a topic, and each subscriber is responsible for updating the accounts in the target systems.

Requirements have been set not only to be used as example, but also to establish a starting point to adapt the integration to your requirements.

As implemented, this template leverages the Mule batch module. The batch job is divided into *Process* and *On Complete* stages.

The integration can be triggered in two different ways: by a scheduler defined in the endpoints file or by an outbound notification generated by Salesforce. Either way, the application queries or receives newest Salesforce updates or creates matching a filter criteria and adds them to a JMS topic.

The application has four different batch jobs consuming this JMS topic, one for migrating the changes to each target system (the second Salesforce Org, Workday, SAP and the database). During the *Process* stage, each Salesforce account is matched with an existing account in the target system by name.
The last step of the *Process* stage groups the accounts and create/update them in target systems.

Finally during the *On Complete* stage the template logs output statistics data into the console.

# Considerations
<!-- Default Considerations (start) -->

<!-- Default Considerations (end) -->

<!-- Considerations (start) -->
To make this template run, there are certain preconditions that must be considered. All of them deal with the preparations in both source and destination systems, that must be made for the template to run smoothly. Failing to do so can lead to unexpected behavior of the template.

**Note:** The batch job fails if you do not provide correct value for Workday Customer Category ID. You need to extend the custom mapping, contained in "Transform Account To SubmitCustomerRequest Type" transformation, if accounts with more than five mapped Salesforce Industry or Workday Customer Category values are updated.

## Database Considerations

This template uses date time or timestamp fields from the database to do comparisons and take further actions. While the template handles the time zone by sending all such fields in a neutral time zone, it cannot handle time offsets. (Time offsets are time differences that may surface between date time and timestamp fields from different systems due to a differences in each system's internal clock.) Take this into consideration and perform the actions needed to avoid the time offset.


### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using a database as a data destination.

## SAP Considerations

Here's what you need to know to get this template to work with SAP.

### As a Data Destination

There are no considerations with using SAP as a data destination.

## Salesforce Considerations

- Where can I check that the field configuration for my Salesforce instance is the right one? See: <a href="https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=checking_field_accessibility_for_a_particular_field.htm&language=en_US">Salesforce: Checking Field Accessibility for a Particular Field</a>.
- How can I modify the Field Access Settings? See: [Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings](https://help.salesforce.com/HTViewHelpDoc?id=modifying_field_access_settings.htm&language=en_US "Salesforce: Modifying Field Access Settings").

### As a Data Source

If a user who configures the template for the source system does not have at least *read only* permissions for the fields that are fetched, then an *InvalidFieldFault* API fault displays.

```
java.lang.RuntimeException: [InvalidFieldFault [ApiQueryFault 
[ApiFault  exceptionCode='INVALID_FIELD'
exceptionMessage='Account.Phone, Account.Rating, Account.RecordTypeId, 
Account.ShippingCity
^
ERROR at Row:1:Column:486
No such column 'RecordTypeId' on entity 'Account'. If you are attempting to 
use a custom field, be sure to append the '__c' after the custom field name. 
Reference your WSDL or the describe call for the appropriate names.'
]
row='1'
column='486'
]

If the category is not found between the specified industries, the **category.default** is used.
<!-- Application Configuration (end) -->

# API Calls
<!-- API Calls (start) -->
Salesforce imposes limits on the number of API Calls that can be made. Therefore calculating this amount may be an important factor to consider. The template calls to the API can be calculated using the formula:

- ***1 + X + X / ${page.size}*** -- Where ***X*** is the number of accounts to synchronize on each run. 
- Divide by ***${page.size}***  because by default, accounts are gathered in groups of ${page.size} for each upsert API call in the commit step. Also consider that these calls are executed repeatedly every polling cycle.	

For instance if 10 records are fetched from the origin instance, then 12 API calls are made (1 + 10 + 1).

# Customize It!
This brief guide provides a high level understanding of how this template is built and how you can change it according to your needs. As Mule applications are based on XML files, this page describes the XML files used with this template. More files are available such as test classes and Mule application files, but to keep it simple, we focus on these XML files:

- config.xml
- businessLogic.xml
- endpoints.xml
- errorHandling.xml
<!-- Customize it (start) -->

<!-- Customize it (end) -->

## config.xml
<!-- Default Config XML (start) -->
This file provides the configuration for connectors and configuration properties. Only change this file to make core changes to the connector processing logic. Otherwise, all parameters that can be modified should instead be in a properties file, which is the recommended place to make changes.
<!-- Default Config XML (end) -->

<!-- Config XML (start) -->

<!-- Config XML (end) -->

## businessLogic.xml
<!-- Default Business Logic XML (start) -->
The business logic XML file creates or updates objects in the destination system for a represented use case. You can customize and extend the logic of this template in this XML file to more meet your needs.
<!-- Default Business Logic XML (end) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (start) -->

<!-- Business Logic XML (end) -->

## endpoints.xml
<!-- Default Endpoints XML (start) -->
This file contains:

1. **push** flow - Contains an HTTP endpoint that listens for notifications from Salesforce. Each of notification is processed and thus updates or creates accounts, and then executes the batch job process.
2. **poll** flow - Contains the Poll endpoint that periodically queries Salesforce for updated or created accounts that meet the defined criteria in the query, and then executing the batch job process.
3. **trigger.policy** property  - Defines from which endpoint the template receives the data. This property can only assume one of two values `push` or `poll`. Any other value results in the template ignoring all messages.
<!-- Default Endpoints XML (end) -->

<!-- Endpoints XML (start) -->
